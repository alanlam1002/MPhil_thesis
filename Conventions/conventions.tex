\begin{conventions}
Unless explicitly stated, we adopt the geometrized Heaviside-Lorentz units,
for which the speed of light $c$, gravitational constant $G$, solar mass $M_\odot$,
vacuum permittivity $\epsilon_0$ and vacuum permeability $\mu_0$ are all equal to one
$(c=G=M_\odot =\epsilon_0 =\mu_0 =1)$.
Greek indices (e.g. $\mu, \nu, \rho, \sigma, \dots$), 
running from 0 to 3,
are used for 4-quantities 
while the Roman indices (e.g. $i,j,k,\dots$), 
running from 1 to 3, are used for 3-quantities.
